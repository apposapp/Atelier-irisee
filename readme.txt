Pattern configurator for WooCommerce: pattern and size, matching fabric, buttons and zips, added to the cart as one linked set.

== Description ==

* Patterns are variable products with one variation per size.
* Each size stores how much fabric it needs (in units of 10 cm), which fabric categories are allowed, how many buttons and zips it needs, the zip length, and the bust, waist and height measurements.
* The `[atelier_irisee_configurator]` shortcode guides the customer through four steps: pattern and size, then fabric, then buttons and zips, then a summary.
* Everything is added to the cart in one go. Stock is checked first, quantities are locked to the chosen size, and the lines stay linked, so removing one removes the whole set.
* Compatible with HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage) and the Cart and Checkout blocks.
* Updates are delivered automatically from GitHub releases.

== Installation ==

1. Download `atelier-irisee-master-plugin.zip` from the latest GitHub release and upload it under Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin.
2. Go to WooCommerce > Atelier Irisee and choose your Patterns, Fabrics, Buttons and Zips categories.
3. Fill in the material requirements on each pattern size. The Atelier Irisee box is shown on every variation.
4. Fill in "Zip length (cm)" on each zip product.
5. Add `[atelier_irisee_configurator]` to a page.
